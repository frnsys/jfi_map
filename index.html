            <h1>Unequal and Uneven: The Geography of Higher Education Access</h1>
            <p>The school concentration index (<span class="smallcaps">SCI</span>) is a new tool that measures local concentration in higher education markets. Using driving distances and school enrollment data across all higher education institutional types except advanced degrees, this interactive map visualizes this concentration by zip code tabulation area. (<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html">Zip code tabulation areas</a> are areal representations of the more familiar <span class="smallcaps">USPS ZIP</span> code service areas; we use the short form “zip” here for ease of reading.) The <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> ranges from 0, indicating perfect competition, to 10,000, indicating that one school accounts for all the enrollment for that zip; on the map, this range is visualized as green (perfect competition) to dark red (single monopolist). Zips that are maroon in color indicate an education desert—no higher ed nearby. Dark maroon areas are those with no associated zip—areas with no residents, like national parks or bodies of water.</p>
            <p>As you explore the map, note that the <span class="smallcaps">DOJ</span> and <span class="smallcaps">FTC</span> use similar indices to measure market concentration in all types of markets. According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/herfindahl-hirschman-index">their benchmarks</a>, a highly concentrated market scores above 2500 on the scale.</p>
            <p>This map is the first in a series of publications examining market power in the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> higher education system, and its effects on cost, access, indebtedness, and earning power.

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>The academic year represented here is 2016 - 2017. For more information on the implications of the map and our preliminary  findings, read our <a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/geography-of-higher-ed" target="_blank">report here</a>. Below, find explanations of all variables. Email us with questions about methods and findings <a href="mailto:jfi@jainfamilyinstitute.org">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Variables derived for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>School Concentration Index (SCI)</b> - We modeled the calculation of the <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> based on the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/herfindahl-hirschman-index">Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (<span class="smallcaps">HHI</span>)</a>. The <span class="smallcaps">HHI</span> calculates market share for a particular company within a particular market; we calculate enrollment share for a particular school in a particular zip code tabulation area <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> ranges from 0 (perfect competition) to 10,000 (complete monopoly). A <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> of 10,000 indicates one school accounts for all the enrollment for that <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>.
                    <p>$$ \text{SCI}_{\text{ZCTA}} = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + \dots + s_n^2 $$</p>
                    <div>Every <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> has a unique School Concentration Index where $n$ number of schools in each <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> equals the amount of schools where it is possible to drive to the associated <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> within 30, 45, or 60 minutes, depending on the selected map view. Each $s_n$ is the undergraduate enrollment share of a school within the geographic area, expressed as a whole number rather than a fraction.</div>
                </li>
                <li><b>Number of Schools</b> - The number of schools displayed for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is a tally of the schools considered within a 30, 45, or 60 minute drive from at least a subsection of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. <em>Number of schools</em> variable takes a whole number.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Enrollment</b> - The enrollment displayed for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is the summation of the enrollment for every school considered within a 30, 45, or 60 minute drive from at least a subsection of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. <em>Enrollment</em> variable takes a whole number and is sourced from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> 12-Month Enrollment Table. This number indicates how many unduplicated undergraduate individuals enrolled for credit the institution served over a 12 month period, regardless of when the individual enrolled.
                    <p>$$ \text{Enrollment}_{\text{ZCTA}} = \text{enrollment}_1 + \text{enrollment}_2 + \dots + \text{enrollment}_n $$</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>25 Mile Zone Population Estimate</b> - In place of population estimates for individual <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>, we list the summation of all the population estimates for the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s within 25 miles of the selected area; the purpose being to complement the zone-type scale used for the <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span>. The 25 mile population zone originates from the mathematical centroid of each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>.
                    <p>$$ \text{Pop}_{\text{ZCTA-ZONE}} = \text{pop}_1 + \text{pop}_2 + \dots + \text{pop}_n $$</p>
                    <div>Every <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> has a unique <em>25 Mile Zone Population Estimate</em> where $n$ number of <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s in each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>-zone equals the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s accessible to the root <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> within 25 miles. Each $\text{pop}_n$ is the 5-year population estimate for that specific <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. Both $\text{pop}_n$ and $\text{Pop}_{\text{ZCTA-ZONE}}$ take a whole number.</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clear-cut variables per <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Zip Code Tabulation Area</b> - (Via the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Census Bureau) <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s are generalized areal representations of United States Postal Service <span class="smallcaps">ZIP</span> Code service areas.</li>
                <li><b>Institution Name</b> - These names are sourced from the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> Institutional Characteristics table. It represents the Institution or Entity Name.</li>
                <li><b>Level of Institution</b> - Level of Institutions are sourced from the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> Institutional Characteristics table. A classification of whether an institution’s programs are 4-year or higher (4 year aka <em>Bachelors</em>), 2-but-less-than 4-year (2 year aka <em>Associates</em>), or less than 2-years (aka <em>Below Associate</em>).</li>
                <li><b>Control of Institution</b> - Control of Institutions and definitions are sourced from the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> Institutional Characteristics table. A classification of whether an institution is operated by publicly elected or appointed officials or by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Public institution</em> - An educational institution whose programs and activities are operated by publicly elected or appointed school officials and which is supported primarily by public funds.</li>
                        <li><em>Private not-for-profit institution</em> - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives no compensation, other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. These include both independent not-for-profit schools and those affiliated with a religious organization.</li>
                        <li><em>Private for-profit institution</em> - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives compensation other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Population Estimate</b> - Estimate; American Community Survey 5-year Estimates for the Total Population of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. Population Estimates for <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Territories besides Puerto Rico are only available with the Census Bureau’s 2010 Census Data and only at the State Level. <em>Used to create the 25 Mile Zone Population Estimate.</em></li>
                <li><b>Median Income Estimate</b> - Estimate; Median household income in the past 12 months (in 2016 inflation-adjusted dollars) from American Community Survey 2012 - 2016 5-year estimates. If a <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> does not have a Median Income listed, this indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate. For example, most <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Territories do not have median income information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Exclusion Criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We excluded schools that offered exclusively advanced degrees, exclusively distance learning degrees, and schools where level and control of institution were unknown. Also excluded were administrative offices of institutions when the institution itself was counted separately. For public schools, driving distances were restricted to the state where the school was located. If a school offered a bachelors or higher degree but no degree below bachelors and the undergraduate enrollment was below 100, the school was excluded.</li>
